<h2 class="decorated2"><span>Fender News</span></h2>

<p class="maintext">Fender has released two limited-edition guitars to commemorate the Jaguar's 60th anniversary as part of its 2022 collection. The first guitar (the American-made 60th Anniversary Jaguar) has an alder body with nitrocellulose lacquer finishes in Mystic Dakota Red or Mystic Lake Placid Blue, as well as matching painted headstocks. They have a conventional scale length of 24 inches. A strangling switch and two single-coil pickups are included in the wiring. The second guitar (American Ultra Luxe Jaguar: A Non-Traditional Jaguar) has a black finish with a lot of chrome. Fender has gone against the grain here, adding a pair of wide-range Double-Tap humbuckers, as well as a blade selector switch and coil-split switches, to the mix.</p>

<p class="maintext">
News concerning Bob Dylan has recently emerged. Bob Dylan is currently in the process of re-recording some of his classic songs in high fidelity audio, producer T Bone Burnett has revealed. According to Burnett, he and Dylan have been in the studio to record the new songs as part of the launch for Burnett’s new high fidelity medium Ionic Originals. It’s not clear what form an Ionic Original will take, when we might hear Dylan’s newly re-recorded tracks, or which songs have been redeveloped, but a press release says Burnett’s creation aims to “reset the valuation of recorded music.”. This clearly presents a big step in music and presents the impact technological innovation has upon the music industry.
