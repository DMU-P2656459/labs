  <p class="maintext">Our pick for Guitarist of the day today is Jimi Hendrix. Guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was born in Seattle on November 27th, 1942 and died on September 18, 1970. Hendrix grew up playing guitar, imitating blues greats like Muddy Waters. In the early 1960s, Hendrix worked as a pickup guitarist, backing musicians including B.B. King, Ike and Tina Turner, and Little Richard. In 1964, he moved to New York, where bassist Bryan Chandler of the British group the Animals heard him. They created the Jimi Hendrix Experience with bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell. The band’s first single, “Hey Joe,” hit No. 6 on the British pop charts, and the band became an instant sensation.
Hendrix was quickly established as a rock superstar. The band released many classic songs such as “Purple Haze,” “Foxy Lady,” and “The Wind Cries Mary.”. Jimi Hendrix has influenced many guitarists since his death. Clearly displaying the legend, he truly is.
