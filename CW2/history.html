<p class="maintext">Jimmy Page is an English musician best known for being the guitarist and founding member of the iconic rock band 'Led Zeppelin.' He began his career as a studio session musician in London, where he is also a superb songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Elvis Presley influenced him as a young lad, and he began playing the guitar at the age of 12. Though he had some instruction at first, he was mostly self-taught. He started to play in local halls as a teenager, and at the age of 15, he joined the band 'The Crusaders.' However, due to an illness, he had to put his musical career on hold and decided to concentrate on his education. But he couldn't stay away from music for long, and he began performing while still a student. Within a few years, he had established himself as a talented instrumentalist, and with singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham, he formed the rock band 'Led Zeppelin.' The band went on to become known as the forefathers of heavy metal and hard rock, and they had tremendous success.</p>
