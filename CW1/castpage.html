  <p>Johnny Utah is the main protagonist in the 1991 action film and its remake Point Break. Former Ohio State Buckeyes quarterback and rookie FBI. Agent Johnny Utah is assigned to assist experienced agent and Vietnam veteran Angelo Pappas in investigating a string of bank robberies by the "Ex-Presidents" (who are thought to be surfers). Utah goes undercover to infiltrate the surfing community. He persuades orphaned surfer Tyler Endicott to teach him to surf after she saved him from drowning during his first attempt at surfing. Through her, he meets Bohdi, the charismatic leader of a gang of surfers consisting of Roach, Grommet, and Nathaniel. The group are initially wary of Utah, but accept him when Bodhi recognizes him as the former college football star. As he masters the art of surfing, Utah finds himself increasingly drawn to the surfers' adrenaline-charged lifestyle.Watching Bodhi's group surfing, Utah begins to suspect that they are the "Ex-Presidents,". </p>

<p>Bodhi is the main antagonist in the 1991 action film Point Break. Bodhi is a charismatic man who loves surfing and living life to the fullest, which includes engaging in many dangerous and exciting activities such as skydiving and Bodhi's biography is extremely unknown. He is also a bank robber who robs banks with his accomplices in order to fund their lifestyle and to be able to search the best locations to surf. FBI agent Johnny Utah develops a complex friendship with Bodhi and his fellow surfers, Roach, Grommet and Nathaniel. Bodhi is an exceptionally skilled extreme sports athlete, who is in incredible physical shape and mental strength. He is enormously skilled at: rafting, base-jumping, sky diving, rock climbing, vehicular driving, parachuting, marksmanship and surfing. He was the only person able to accomplish completing all the 8 ordeals. A near impossible feat as an athlete can train his or her entire life to maybe complete just one ordeal.
Bodhi can design complicated plans to perform ordeals and pull off crimes. Perhaps his most powerful tool is his mind, as he was able to stay perfectly calm and act with full efficiency even while facing sudden death.</p>
